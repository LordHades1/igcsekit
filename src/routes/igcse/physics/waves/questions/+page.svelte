      difficulty: 'Easy',

        'The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of refraction.',
        'The angle of incidence is greater than the angle of reflection.',

        p(`The correct answer is: Some of the light emerges into the air and some is reflected back into the block.`),
        p(`Since the angle of incidence is less than the ciritical angle, total internal reflection will not occur. However, partial internal reflection may occur. Most of the light is expected to emerge into the air but some of the light will be reflected back into the glass.`),

      question: 'Which frequency produces a sound with the largest wavelength and can be heard by a human?',

      correctChoice: 1,
      explanation: join(
        p(`The correct answer is: 150 kHz.`),
        p(`The audible frequency range for humans is 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Frequency is invsersely proportional to wavelength. Therefore, the lowest audible frequency will produce the largest audible wavelength.`),
